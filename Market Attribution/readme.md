### Introduction
<aside>
ðŸ’¡ CoolTShirts, is an innovative apparel shop, is running a bunch of marketing campaigns. In this project, Iâ€™ll be helping them assess and improve their marketing campaigns
</aside>

This project used data from the database, __*Page_visits*__ ,to assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

The database has the following columns and used the schema that follows:

- `user_id`Â - A unique identifier for each visitor to a page
- `timestamp`Â - The time at which the visitor came to the page
- `page_name`Â - The title of the section of the page that was visited
- `utm_source`Â - Identifies which touchpoint sent the traffic (e.g. google, email, or facebook)
- `utm_medium`Â - Identifies what type of link was used (e.g. cost-per-click or email)
- `utm_campaign`Â - Identifies the specific ad or email blast (e.g. retargetting-ad or weekly-newsletter)

Database Schema

| page_name | TEXT |
| timestamp |	TEXT |
| user_id | INTEGER |
| utm_campaign | TEXT |
