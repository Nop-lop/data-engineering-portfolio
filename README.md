### Welcome to my projects and portfolio page! ü§ì

Before diving into the projects, here is a summary of the tools used in the projects executed as I become a better Data Scientist
The projects will explore various aspects of data science with an increasing focus on Machine Learning:
1. SQL projects - include data querying, manipulation and working with RDBMSs using SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL. The choice of language depends on the connection to databse available whether its cloud services (SSH keys), reading large CSV files or working from the terminal.
2. EDA and Data Analysis- these skills are imbued in most projects and showcase Data visualization, data cleaning and tidying skills along with exploring variable relationships and presenting summary statistics using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn as key tools.
3. ML projects will have a heavy focus in building algorithms and implementing Machine learning and Deep learning models like Regressions, SVM's and Neural networks
