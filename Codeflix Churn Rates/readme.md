As the data analyst, I am tasked by the management to look into subscription performance as main stakeholders are excited about our growth! ðŸ˜Š

### SCHEMA
The marketing team are particularly interested in how the churn rates compare between two `segment` users. The dataset provided contains the subsciprtion data for the distinct channels.

The SQL table, __`subscriptions`__ , is used to assess the churn and has 4 columns;

- `id`Â - A unique identifier for the subscriber
- `subscription_start`Â - The start date for the subscription
- `subscription_end`Â - The end date for the subscription
- `segment`Â - This identifies which segment the subscriber belongs to


__Note__: Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month

Database Schema
| name | type |
|:------|:------|
| id | INTEGER |
| subscription_start |	TEXT |
| subscription_end | TEXT |
| segment | INTEGER |
| Rows: 2000 | 

-> SQL queries are used to explore the data and calculate the churn rates of segments 30 and 70 between January and March, 2017
